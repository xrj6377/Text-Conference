This is the explanation of the phase 2 of the TextConference lab.

The additional features we have implemented based on the phase 1 of the TextConference lab are Registration and Direct Message.

1. As the function of Registration is implemented, we thought that it is unreasonable to connect the client to the server together with the command /login.
Therefore, we split the connect command as "/connect <ip> <port>", and once the client is connected to the server, users won't have to type the server ip and port
together with Login command and Register Command. The new login command is "/login <username> <password>" and the register command is "/register <username> <password>".
Notice that all the users' usernames and passwords are stored in the local file in the client folder call accounts.txt and it has some default accounts' information.
When server starts and runs, it will read the account information from the accounts.txt file and store the information as a linked list for credential. And whenever a
new account is registered, the information will be append in the linked list and the accounts.txt, therefore, whenever the server is terminated, the account information
can still be found in the local txt files. The user cannot create an account with username that has already been taken.

2. To use the Direct Message command, user may need to know which users are online and are available for him/ her to send the DM with. By using the "/listuser"
command, users can check all the users are currently login the TextConference. When server is processing this command, it will go through the account linked list
and check the boolean value of loggedin (initially false, was set to true when the account is logged in). To distinguish with the command showing users in sessions,
we changed the "/list" command into "/listsession". The user can then send DM to a user who is online now by using command "/<username> <message>". The user who
received the DM will get a message of "<username> <message>" where username is the sender's username. You may send DM while you are in the session, and you can
distinguish the session message as its format is "<sessionname> <message>".
